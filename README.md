## Usage
```console
$ crid <FILE NAME>
```

## Install
```console
$ make install
```
If you don't want to always go to the directory to run the binary.
***
You can look at the source code and compile it yourself, if you are not sure where it came from.
```console
$ make build
```
But the prerequisites for this are the g++ compiler and the cython lib.
